 Phi (.Ï†) - Philomath
----------------------
Phi is a toy programming language that was built to teach myself more about
compiler architecture, byte-code generation, virtual machines, assembly, and
optimizing-compiler techniques.

The code architecture is briefly described in the [implementation](Implementation.md) doc.

To the extent possible under law, I wave all copyright and related or neighboring rights to Philomath.
