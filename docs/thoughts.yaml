Preface: While notes.md is more organized and reasoned, I'm just tossing stray thoughts in here.

Name Mangling:
  Operator overloading: |
    Each operator gets its own symbol name.
    For prefix operators, it must look like "NAME_"
    For postfix operators, it must look like "_NAME"
    For infix operators, it must look like "_NAME_"
    These names are restrict to C naming rules (ie. ASCII alphanumeric).

    For a type "bignum",
      unary prefix "-" is mangled to "neg_bignum"
      binary infix "+" is mangled to "bignum_add_bignum"
      unary postfix "_foo" is mangled to "bignum_foo"

    The compiler will give you an error if there are any conflicts.
    Normal philomath identifiers cannot begin or end with an underscore.

  Module values: |
    These values are mangled by combining module names with values using a double underscore.
    For some module "math",
      the function "tanh" is mangled to "math__tanh"
      the operator "Ã—" for a type "vec3" is mangled to "math__vec3_cross_vec3"
